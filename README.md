## FAQ

**What's the difference between residential and datacenter proxies for my use case?**

Residential proxies use real consumer device IPs assigned by ISPs, making them nearly impossible to detect and ideal for bypassing sophisticated anti-bot systems on platforms like social media or e-commerce sites. Datacenter proxies route through server infrastructure, offering 5-10x faster speeds at lower costs but higher detection risk. Choose residential for anti-bot challenges, datacenter for speed-critical tasks like price monitoring where blocks are less common.

**How do I avoid getting my proxies blocked when scraping websites?**

Implement rotating proxies that change IPs automatically between requests rather than hammering sites with the same address. Add random delays between requests (2-5 seconds) to mimic human behavior. Use residential or mobile proxies for sites with aggressive detection. Respect robots.txt files and rate limits. Most importantly, use sticky sessions for activities requiring consistent IPs like logging into accounts.

**Can I use the same proxy service for multiple different projects simultaneously?**

Yes, most providers support unlimited concurrent connections as long as bandwidth limits aren't exceeded. You can run web scraping, social media automation, and ad verification projects simultaneously using different IPs from the same provider. Use proxy management tools or APIs to organize proxies by project, assign different geographic locations to each task, and track usage separately for better cost allocation.
